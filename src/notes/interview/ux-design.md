# UX Design

## Common UX Questions

### Q. What is design-thinking?

Ans. Design thinking is an approach to solve user's problem. It has three important components.

- The solution has to match with user's needs.
- The solution has to be technologically feasible.
- The solution has to meet requirement of business success.

Designers have to keep all three components into consideration while developing a solution.

### Q. What are other approaches of solving problems? How is design-thinking different from others?

Ans. There are other approaches of solving problems. Some of them are:

- **Lean Startup**: This approach focuses on experimentation. It encourages building an MVP and validating it with customers. Then it focuses on identifying and solving customer problems.
- **Agile Method**: It is mostly used for software development. It involves planning and contineous improvements.

`Empathazing with users` is the difference. Design thinking approach places great value on understanding our user and empathazing with.

### Q. What does empathazing with users actually mean?

Ans. Empathazing means understanding user's POV, their needs, wants and pain points. It's important to understand users to better design solutions which really solves their problems.

### Q. Explain more in detail about design-thinking

Ans. Design thinking is basically creating solution that match user's needs and which is technologically feasible and viable as business strategy.

The process look something like this:

- Emphathize - Understanding users
- Define - identifying user's problems
- Ideate - Ideating potential solutions
- Prototype - Develop sketches, wireframes to better understand as well as communicate ideas to others
- Test - Gather feedback from users as well as others regarding the solution

### Q. What does your design process look like?

Ans. Whenever I get a problem, I try to understand the problem statement first and if I have questions regarding it, I get it clarified from the concerned people.

**Research**

- First, I start with secondary research. It involves getting a understanding of domain the product operates in.
- If it's feasible, I try to get general idea about the problems by going through social platforms like reddit, twitter etc.
- Then I conduct a user survey followed by user interviews. User survey has two role in the process
  - First, I try to screen candidates for user interviews
  - Second, Since survey are conducted with relatively large numbers of users, I get quantitative data which will help in identifying a pattern.
- Goal of user interviews is basically to understand users, their pain points, motivations, needs and wants.

**Define**

- In this stage, I organise data I have gathered through the research state. If data I have gathered is not available, I again go back to users to collect those. For example, if I want to create a sitemap, but I don't have enough knowledge or data to back it up, I will do the card sorting with users.
- I try to create personas, affinity map, sitemap, task and user flows.

**Develop**

- I move to sketching different solutions. Then I filter out and create wireframes for some potential solutions.
- I try to communicate my ideas with designers, developers via sketches and wireframes. The aim of this is to get early feedback. If feedbacks are useful, I try to incorporate them in my designs.
- Then I move on to create high level mocks as well as prototypes.

**Testing**

- After creating the high levels mocks, I test it with real users.
- The objective of this test is primarily to understand
  - If user is able to understand how to navigate through the solution
  - If user is able to complete the tasks without huddles
  - If user is getting stuck somewhere.

**Iterations**

- I gather insights from usability testing and try to fix issues or work on improvements.
